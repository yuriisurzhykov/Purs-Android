# About

Purs-Android is an android version of the test application which is concidered as a "Take Home Assignment"

# Requirements
## Data Layer

â€¢ All operation hours should be grouped in one day. This means that if JSON file contains same day name but different hours of work they have to be displayed in one row. For example, instead of displaying:

_Monday: 10am-12pm_

_Monday: 5pm-9pm_

The application should display:
_Monday: 10am-12pm, 5pm-9pm_
